A recommendation system filters information by predicting ratings or preferences of customers for items that the customers would like to use. It tries to recommend items to the customers according to their needs and taste.


The system analyses the books that were liked by the customer with the unrated books, potentially looking for best-suited content to recommend them.

This system is build using different techniques:
1. Basic First Cut System
   * Top 50 books with best book_average_rating
   * Top 50 concised books
   * Top 50 e-books
   * Books having similar book title
   * Books having similar description
   * Books that got similar review
   * Books where user choice's match

2. Similar Cover-Page of Books
3. Correlation-Based Recommendation
4. Content Based Filtering
5. Collaborative Filtering
   * Memory Based System
